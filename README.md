# ⚓ The Scoobi-Doge Protocol Meme Governance or How to seek for the best

Institutions and companies' hierarchy and decision-making processes are often vertically designed. Sometimes, to innovate governance and leadership need to be challenged. A meme governance token is based upon a decentralized voting system in which every individual could influence a specific ecosystem.

## 📜 Why Blockchain Meme Governance Matters

Like evolution conveys a certain level of adaptation to nature, the most successful blockchains are the ones that can best adapt to their environments. Assuming these dynamic systems need to evolve to survive, initial design and adaptability are both crucial, and over a long period, the adaptive mechanisms of evolution settle the baseline for the ecosystem plasticity. Yet in the decentralized world,  little research has dug into decentralized governance and the subsequent adaptive mechanisms are still poorly understood. Indeed, as the ecosystem gains attention in the community, its shape and stability would both be ultimately impacted. Similar to real life, some members of the community will be active and support the upcoming and running project at stake while others will patiently hold by locking their funds. Therefore, we do believe that modeling the governance by a dedicated token is crucial to innovate and create new interactions as well as expanding blockchains' role in our society. 

## ⚖️ Why Scoobi-Doge Protocol Meme Governance Matters

Meme Governance tokens (MGT) are tokens that are created by developers to allow token holders to shape the future of the King of all Dogs DAO Foundation. 

Scoobi-Doge token holders can influence decisions concerning the project by proposing or deciding on new feature proposals and even changing the governance system itself.

In most cases, the modification of a protocol, vetted and then voted through on-chain Scoobi-Doge protocol governance can be accessed by using GT that are automatically linked due to smart contracts.
The project team maintenance task will remain in any case to apply the changes or hire someone who will.

Scoobi-Doge token allows its holders to vote on decisions about the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that the decentralized stablecoin DAI runs on.


## 🤳 Tik Tok Marketing

There is a new TikTok trend aiming to get the meme-based cryptocurrency’s price to $1.
James Galante began urging his followers to buy Dogecoin in June, claiming they could “all get rich” if enough viewers invested $25 in the coin. Since then, one of his videos garnered more than 537,000 views, search interest skyrocketed, the challenge began trending on Twitter, and the coin briefly hit its highest level since October 2018.

“Let’s all get rich!” Galante said in a July 2 video. “Dogecoin is practically worthless. There are 800 million TikTok users. Once it hits $1, you’ll have $10,000. Tell everyone you know!”
TikTok ads start at $10 per CPM (cost per 1000 views). Also, they require you to spend a minimum of $500 on a campaign. So we aren’t going to use formal TikTok ads for a cheap and cheerful viral marketing campaign. We are planning to put 50k USD diluted in 4 weeks.


## 🐶 What is $SCooBi? 

$SCooBi from "Scoobi-Doge" is a Meme DAO building the ultimate dApps ecosystem. A real meme governance token is based upon a decentralized voting system in which every individual can influence the ecosystem. The ecosystem will be powered by the utility token (codename $BONES 🤫) that will be minted only through staking $SCooBi and $SCooBi LPs. Soon, serveral NFTs named $SCooBi NFT might be issued.

The goal is to gradually build an ecosystem controlled through governance by $SCooBi holders, providing a broad spectrum of coherent defi services to bring stable growth and over time value increase.

$SCooBi will be available both, first on Ethereum and then Binance Smart Chain Mainnet.
